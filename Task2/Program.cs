/*
 * 1.1   Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching 
through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of 
steps it would take?

when we used the Binary search the maximum number of steps can be found using the logarithm function is (7).
the maximum steps = log2(128)  => 2*2*2*2*2*2*2 = 128 == 2^7
*/

/*
 *  1.2   Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum 
number of steps now?

For the initial list 128 names, we saw that the maximum steps were log2(128) ≈ 7 .

after  double the size of the list
128 * 2 = 256
 maximum steps = log2(256)   => log2(2^8)   ==  2^8 = 256    so the maximum steps is  = 8
